This website contains some of my thoughts. Mostly about startups, health and medicine, reasoning, psychology, cryptography, and netsec.

I will not exert much effort to 'write well' here as that takes too much time away from actually thinking about and doing things.

A non-exhaustive list of reasons I blog here:

- to better formulate my own thoughts
- to meet like-minded people
- to contribute to the sum total of humanity's knowledge and help drive discourse
