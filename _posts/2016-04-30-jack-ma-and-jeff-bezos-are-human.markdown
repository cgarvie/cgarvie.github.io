We often conflate the founders of unicorns with their unicorns, and build a mythology around the seemingly superhuman founder. I recently told some people that I intended to build a company that competed with Alibaba, and someone jokingly warned, “Look out, Jack Ma."

But what’s so impressive about Jack Ma, really? I mean other than the fact that he created the Alibaba Group, one of the largest e-commerce empires in the world and which is probably destined to be the largest. I ask that question sincerely.

At a conference in 2010, Jack Ma revealed that he has never actually written a line of code nor made a sale to a customer. He encountered a computer for the first time at the age of 33. Okay, so he’s not a genius programmer or salesman. Maybe he’s an amazing leader, or an incredibly shrewd businessman?

If we look at his life, do we see any evidence that he was an amazing leader or a shrewd businessman prior to him starting Alibaba? I’m not questioning that he’s a great leader or a shrewd businessman now, but no one comes into this world as a shrewd businessman. We are all born as babies, and the only way to progress from that to a shrewd businessman or leader is through dedication and practice. If we don’t see obvious examples of this in his life prior to Alibaba then it makes more sense to believe that rather than him starting Alibaba because he’s a great leader, he’s a great leader because he started Alibaba.

So if the guy who started Alibaba wasn’t particularly qualified or impressive, how on earth did he manage to do so?

It’s quite clear now that buying things online is a form of commerce that was bound to come into existence and become wildly popular. The reason Jack Ma runs one of the largest e-commerce websites on the world is because he was born in China at roughly the right time. Had he been born in Moldova, he would be the king of e-commerce in Moldova and wouldn’t seem quite as impressive. Had he been born in China but a few years later, someone else would likely have already built Alibaba. Jeff Bezos and Jack Ma are the kings of e-commerce partly because they were born in the nations with the largest customer bases with the most purchasing power, at roughly the right time.

Read about Founders' lives up until they had their incredible success, and there’s obviously never any other accomplishments that come close in scale to that of their unicorn. There are common themes — diligence, perseverance, etc. — but nothing superhuman. Jack Ma has never done anything else nearly as impressive as the only thing that we know him for. And how do we know that they are impressive individuals? Mostly because of the thing that makes them impressive. If we’re open to the possibility that there is a lot of good fortune involved in building a successful startup, then our logic starts to feel troublingly cyclical.
