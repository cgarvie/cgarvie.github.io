Parasites is a loaded term and refers to a large number of species, a subset of which are not 'bad' for us for the same reason that the pop-sci good/bad bacteria terminology creates a false and dangerous dichotomy; the correct way to think about the issue is in terms of dysbiosis.

If you are considering helminthic therapy or are an active user, you probably tumbled down the rabbit hole by learning about what an [autoimmune disease][autoimmune-disease] is, then about [diseases of affluence][diseases-of-affluence], then about the [hygiene hypothesis][hygiene-hypothesis], then finally about [helminthic therapy][helminthic-therapy].

If you haven't already, you should read all of those Wikipedia pages.

These are theories, and unproven, but they make sense. The reasoning is sound and in the most conservative case we can stop being so afraid of mostly benign parasites and can make an argument for increased zoological contact in order to train one's immune system.

The problem is that this evolutionary approach tends to fly out the window as soon as treatment decisions have to be made. People begin helminthic therapy with very rational reasons, and then quickly become very irrational, as though the worms have migrated to their brains and seized control, focusing single-mindedly on growing their wiggle.

Essentially, the majority of helminthic therapy users end up using helminths in the same manner that you would use a drug: increasing dosage gradually until side effects make treatment unsustainable, at which point they are, in my opinion, way past a defensible headcount.

First 25 worms, then 50, then 100, then 200, then 400... until the user has to supplement iron to avoid becoming anemic.

In most cases of dysfunctional immune systems, helminths are simply one missing piece of the puzzle.

But helminthic therapy none-the-less becomes the treatment of choice, partly because people generally have a magic-bullet bias. More reasonably, though, it often becomes the treatment of choice because it has fewer side effects than the alternatives and the quality-of-life improvement is a better deal.

I'm not trying to be critical; I understand that this constant dosage escalation is a manifestation of people getting some relief from a great amount of suffering, and I wish them nothing but the best. Often, I would even agree that additional helminths are the best option they have.

My point is simply that there's no good reason to defend therapeutic use of helminths that has long passed the point of evolutionary reason as paleolithic. On some level it's obviously a bit silly it casts doubt on the therapy as a whole, thus probably turning away prospective users.

If you are a healthy person and are sold on the paleolithic argument for hosting helminths, I think you'd be served well by just walking around barefoot, occasionally in natural but dirty places. A strong counterargument to this would be that perhaps due to our unnaturally-sterile modern world we need to expose ourselves to an unnatural level of probiotics such as helminths, which is getting a bit reductionist, but I'm open-minded to it.
