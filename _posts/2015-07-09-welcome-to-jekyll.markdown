Many FMT patients with IBD report that they had to complete many, many infusions prior to finding relief - often more than 30 infusions.

On the other hand, clinics and individuals treating C. diff often perform just a single infusion with success.

Personally, I performed eight infusions over a period of roughly two weeks in order to cure dysbiosis and improve immune issues and noticed immediate changes as well as gradual improvement into the future. Some of my symptoms were cured immediately, and others were cured several weeks after the cessation of infusions.

The facts that many IBD patients require many infusions is often explained to be caused by the resilience of bacterial colonies and biofilms, but it's hard to reconcile that explanation with the fact that C. diff patients require far fewer infusions.

I theorize that it is possible that the primary difference between performing dozens of infusions and performing merely a handful of infusions is that the former takes much longer to complete, thus giving the immune system time to improve prior to the patient evaluating the efficacy of their treatment.

In other words, I think it's entirely possible that performing only a minimum of infusions may be sufficient for cases of IBD. It is possible that performing 30 infusions works because the first infusion was sufficient but takes 'one month to work its magic', and performing the other 29 takes 29 additional days.

Dietary changes cause autoimmune changes over a period of weeks or months. Autoimmune-specific dietary protocols mandate that the patient try the diet for at least two weeks and often longer.

Studies on the effects of probiotics on the immune system (typically allergies) notice delayed action as well.

In the case of helminthic therapy, a parasite (or more affectionately, a co-evolved symbiotic organism) is introduced to the microbiome and matures within XXX days. Yet the benefits of helminthic therapy on the immune system are never realized until roughly three months after inoculation and many users report that improvements continue for at least more than two years.

(This obviously leads to questions regarding studies of helminthic therapy, which typically follow patients for 6 months at most. Some studies, for some bizarre reason, only follow patients for three months, and I expect that this set of studies tend to have pessimistic conclusions compared to longer studies.)

Allogenic bone marrow transplant is another relevant transplant. New blood cells which follow the transplanted marrow's recipe don't begin to be created until anywhere from 10 days to four weeks post-procedure. Acute Graft-versus-host disease, a complication of marrow transplants where the new immune system sees its host body as a threat and attacks it, will come two-to-five months later (if it occurs) by a typical timeline.

I don't know much about how the gut and immune system interact, but nobody else does either. I think we can prudently assume that changes to the gut biome will take time to take effect and that the effects may continue to evolve for months or years post-procedure.

IBD is a class of conditions in which the immune system plays a starring role, and so I think this theory makes a bit of sense and helps reconcile the seemingly conflicting facts presented at the beginning of this post.

If you are reading this because you are investigating FMT, and you suffer from immune dysfunction which you believe may have been partially or fully caused by antibiotic use, ask yourself: how much time elapsed between the antibiotic use and the immune dysfunction?

Biome changes likely take a very long time to propagate.
