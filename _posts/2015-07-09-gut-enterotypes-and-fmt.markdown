Gut enterotypes and FMT: a brief, relevant history of blood transfusions

A 2011 Nature article birthed the idea of gut enterotypes
I am skeptical of the lazy conclusions spouted by the pop-science journalists who covered Bork's journal article, for various reasons. Many decently clever people pretty immediately proposed that the primary determinant of enterotype is likely recent diet.

Chimpanzees have enterotypes that are compositionally analogous to those found in humans and longitudinal sampling has found that the enterotype of individual chimpanzees varied over time.

Correlational studies in humans and a mass of longitudinal do-it-yourself experiments substantiate this theory.

However, I am open to the more general possibility that there are hard-wired or otherwise fundamental differences between our microbiomes.

I am myself too young to remember a time before blood types, but the history of hematology is relevant here.

In the early 1900s, Karl Landsteiner discovered that each person belonged to one of four blood types.

At least one person, a guy named Jan Jansky, independently discovered the same thing before him, but this was before the internet and distributed trustless proof-of-existence systems, so Karl got the credit.

Prior to this discovery and the implementation of donor matching, most blood transfusions would be rejected by the recipient's body.

In the event that genetic code or formative years or another relatively cementing process determines some form of gut enterotype, then this discovery may one day retroactively explain the spotty positive and negative results of FMT today.
